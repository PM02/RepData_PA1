```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
Check Library is Loaded
```{r}
require(ggplot2)
```

Calculate the Steps per day
```{r}
steps_per_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data, sum)
```

Construct a histogram. Breaks are set to **25**
```{r}
hist(steps_per_day$steps, 
+      breaks = 25,
+      main = "Frequency of Number of Steps Per Day",
+      xlab = "Number of steps",
+      col = "#008888")
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
